# MCP Server Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a lightweight, Node.js-based backend system designed to connect AI models with external data sources, tools, and services. It acts as a secure and standardized bridge, enabling AI applications to efficiently access resources and perform tasks.
Key Features

    Resource Access: Exposes files, databases, and other resources via unique URIs.
    Tool Invocation: Provides executable functions for AI models to trigger specific operations.
    Prompt Templates: Supplies structured instructions for consistent AI inputs.
    Secure Authentication: Manages credentials through environment variables for enhanced security.
    Scalability: Leverages Node.js for efficient handling of concurrent requests.

Technologies

    Node.js: Powers the core runtime.
    Express.js: Handles API routing and middleware.
    JSON-RPC 2.0: Ensures structured communication.
    OAuth 2.1: Optional framework for secure access control.

Integration

The MCP server integrates seamlessly with the Assay Capture and Analysis System (ACAS), utilizing the ACAS roo-server for database interactions to maintain schema consistency and streamline functionality.
Deployment

    Deployed as a container, configured to work with ACAS containers.
    Uses environment variables for flexible and secure configuration.

Important Notes

    Verify permissions for resource and tool access.
    Keep dependencies updated to address security and compatibility.
    Monitor performance and logs for optimal operation.

This server is ideal for developers building AI-driven applications that require robust, secure, and scalable integration with external systems.
